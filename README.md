# StockAnalysis ðŸ’¬ 

A simple Streamlit app that shows how to build a AI Powered StockAnalysis for DataU Capstone project. We basically can get data running directly on python, yet we decided to go through ETL CSV to Database, to Power BI all the way to streamlit app. 

# Technologies use:

```
- ETL using SSIS
- Power BI
- Python:
  - pyodbc
  - Streamlit
  - plotly
  - OpenAI
```
